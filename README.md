# Final-Project-1051

# Biggest challenges faced and how I overcame them 

Audio file compatabilitiy, figuring out which library accepted which file type 
solution - made a different varibale for respective file types, had to switch from librosa to pygame.

Empty audio data, when I was trying at first a difficult challenge was being able to read audio data and convert it to an array
solution - used a different module entirely.

Threading for audio playback after several times of it not working regularly.
